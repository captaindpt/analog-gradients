=== Binary 2x2 Matmul (Digital Baseline) Verification ===
Binary-only proof: AND partial products + XOR/AND two-term adder
Date: Feb  8 21:15:28 2026

Stimulus matrix (fixed proof point):
  A = [[1 0] [1 1]]
  B = [[1 1] [0 1]]

Expected output:
  Y = [[1 1] [1 2]]

Sampled output bits @ 30.0 ns:
  y11=(msb=0 lsb=1)
  y12=(msb=0 lsb=1)
  y21=(msb=0 lsb=1)
  y22=(msb=1 lsb=0)

Decoded output matrix: [[1 1] [1 2]]
Latency to full output-valid: 0.141 ns
Total energy (0-90ns): 5.960843e-14 J
Energy per operation (12 ops): 4.967369e-15 J/op

OK: binary matmul decoded outputs match expected matrix

=== PASS: Binary 2x2 digital matmul baseline verified ===

Waveform Analysis:
==================

Membrane maxima:
  mem0: 0.792 V
  mem1: 0.792 V
  mem2: 0.792 V
  mem3: 0.792 V

OK: all membrane nodes integrated synaptic drive

Spike pulse counts:
  spike0: 14 (min=0.011V max=0.799V)
  spike1: 14 (min=0.011V max=0.799V)
  spike2: 14 (min=0.011V max=0.799V)
  spike3: 14 (min=0.011V max=0.795V)

OK: all neurons produced spike pulses
First spike times (ns): 27.5, 29.5, 31.5, 33.5
OK: channel staggering preserved in first spike timing

=== PASS: Neuro Tile4 verified ===

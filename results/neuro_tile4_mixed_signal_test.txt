=== Neuro Tile4 Mixed-Signal Verification ===
Digital enable gating of analog spike propagation
Date: Feb  3 15:32:41 2026

Waveform Analysis:
==================

Enable rising edge: 140.50 ns

Spike counts before enable (20ns .. 135.5ns):
  spike0=6 spike1=0 spike2=0 spike3=0
Spike counts after enable (160.5ns .. 300ns):
  spike0=7 spike1=7 spike2=7 spike3=7
OK: source channel remains active
OK: downstream channels mostly quiescent before enable
OK: downstream propagation appears after digital enable

=== PASS: Mixed-signal gating behavior verified ===

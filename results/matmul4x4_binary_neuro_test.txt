Transistor checkpoint: coincidence products + membrane accumulation
Date: Feb  8 21:15:19 2026

Stimulus matrices:
  A = [[1 0 1 1] [0 1 1 0] [1 1 0 1] [1 0 0 1]]
  B = [[1 1 0 1] [0 1 1 0] [1 0 1 1] [0 1 1 1]]

Expected output Y = [[2 2 2 3] [1 1 2 1] [1 3 2 2] [1 2 1 2]]

Decoded output from partial products:
  row0: 2 2 2 3
  row1: 1 1 2 1
  row2: 1 3 2 2
  row3: 1 2 1 2

Decoded output vector: 2 2 2 3 1 1 2 1 1 3 2 2 1 2 1 2

Total partial spikes: 28
Latency to full output-valid: 2.239 ns
Total energy (0-120ns): 5.337693e-11 J
Energy per operation (112 ops): 4.765797e-13 J/op
Spike-model energy estimate (3.27 pJ/spike): 9.156000e-11 J

OK: decoded outputs match expected 4x4 matrix

=== PASS: Binary 4x4 neuro matmul checkpoint verified ===

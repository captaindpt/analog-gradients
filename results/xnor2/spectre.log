Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(n2) = 1.805 V
I: I(V_VDD:p) = 271.3 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

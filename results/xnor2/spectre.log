*****************************************************
Transient Analysis `tran_test': time = (0 s -> 80 ns)
*****************************************************

Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran_test'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(X_N1.mid) = 10 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Convergence achieved in 36 iterations.
DC simulation time: CPU = 493 us, elapsed = 493.05 us.

Notice from spectre during transient analysis `tran_test'.
    Trapezoidal ringing is detected during tran analysis.
        Please use method=trap for better results and performance.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(n2) = 1.964 V
I: I(V_VDD:p) = 75.45 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

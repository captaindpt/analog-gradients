Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran_test'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(X_GPU.X_PE4.X_PE0.X_ALU.X0.X_M2.X_AND1.X_NAND.mid) = 10 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Convergence achieved in 76 iterations.

Warning from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran_test'.
    WARNING (SPECTRE-17192): 
        Tolerance relaxation is used during DC simulation which may affect the accuracy of the result. This is mainly caused by the high impedance nodes in the circuit. Use the dyn_highz check to determine the high impedance nodes. Setting/assigning appropriate initial values to these nodes will usually help to improve both performance and accuracy of DC simulations.

DC simulation time: CPU = 53.159 ms, elapsed = 53.3371 ms.

Notice from spectre during transient analysis `tran_test'.
    Trapezoidal ringing is detected during tran analysis.
        Please use method=trap for better results and performance.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(X_GPU.X_PE4.X_PE1.X_ALU.X2.X_ADD.X_OR.X_NOR.mid) = 2.25 V
I: I(V_VDD:p) = 4.224 mA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

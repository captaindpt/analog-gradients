Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran_test'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Convergence achieved in 28 iterations.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(X_PE.X_ALU.X1.m0) = 1.865 V
I: I(V_VDD:p) = 4.753 mA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

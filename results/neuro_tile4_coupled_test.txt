4-neuron feed-forward coupled tile
Date: Feb  8 21:14:39 2026

Waveform Analysis:
==================

Sampling step for spike detection: 0.100 ns

Membrane maxima (V): 0.642, 0.993, 1.216, 0.756

OK: all membranes show integration activity

Spike pulse counts:
  spike0=15 spike1=15 spike2=15 spike3=15
Spike maxima (V): 1.052, 1.263, 0.850, 1.798
OK: source channel spike0 active
OK: downstream channels spike (propagation observed)
First spike times (ns): 9.676, 12.257, 13.215, 13.727
OK: feed-forward ordering preserved

=== PASS: Neuro Tile4 coupled propagation verified ===

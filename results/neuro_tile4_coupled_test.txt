Waveform Analysis:
==================

Membrane maxima (V): 0.569, 0.974, 1.268, 0.873

OK: all membranes show integration activity

Spike pulse counts:
  spike0=15 spike1=15 spike2=1 spike3=1
Spike maxima (V): 1.040, 1.319, 0.974, 1.773
OK: source channel spike0 active
OK: downstream channels spike (propagation observed)
First spike times (ns): 8.0, 9.5, 9.5, 8.5
WARN: first-spike ordering not strictly monotonic

=== PASS: Neuro Tile4 coupled propagation verified ===

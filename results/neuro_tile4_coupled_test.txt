=== Neuro Tile4 Coupled Verification ===
4-neuron feed-forward coupled tile
Date: Feb  3 20:52:18 2026

Waveform Analysis:
==================

Sampling step for spike detection: 0.100 ns

Membrane maxima (V): 0.635, 0.971, 1.184, 0.756

OK: all membranes show integration activity

Spike pulse counts:
  spike0=15 spike1=15 spike2=15 spike3=15
Spike maxima (V): 1.060, 1.257, 0.893, 1.798
OK: source channel spike0 active
OK: downstream channels spike (propagation observed)
First spike times (ns): 9.388, 11.896, 12.985, 13.640
OK: feed-forward ordering preserved

=== PASS: Neuro Tile4 coupled propagation verified ===

=== Binary 2x2 Matmul (Neuro Path) Verification ===
Binary-only proof: product via coincidence, sum via integration
Date: Feb  4 14:00:53 2026

Stimulus matrix (fixed proof point):
  A = [[1 0] [1 1]]
  B = [[1 1] [0 1]]

Expected output:
  Y = [[1 1] [1 2]]

Partial product spike counts:
  ae=1 bg=0 af=1 bh=0 ce=1 dg=0 cf=1 dh=1

Total partial spikes: 5

Partial product maxima (V):
  ae=0.594 bg=0.051 af=0.594 bh=0.051 ce=0.594 dg=0.051 cf=0.663 dh=0.663

Decoded output from partial products:
  y11=1 y12=1 y21=1 y22=2

Accumulator membrane maxima (V):
  y11=0.115 y12=0.115 y21=0.115 y22=0.245

Latency to full output-valid: 2.233 ns
Total energy (0-90ns): 1.120208e-11 J
Energy per operation (12 ops): 9.335063e-13 J/op
Spike-model energy estimate (3.27 pJ/spike): 1.635000e-11 J

OK: binary matmul decoded outputs match expected matrix
OK: two-term sum output (y22=2) has strongest integrated response
OK: y=1 outputs integrate above baseline

=== PASS: Binary 2x2 neuro matmul proof verified ===

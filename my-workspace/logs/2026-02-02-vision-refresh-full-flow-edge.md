# Session: 2026-02-02 - Vision Refresh (Full-Flow Edge)

## Summary

Updated vision and reference docs to reflect the new strategic edge:
demonstrating a reproducible transistor-to-GDS-ready path for ICTGC.

## Updated Files

- `my-workspace/docs/vision.md`
- `my-workspace/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `my-workspace/docs/STATUS.md`
- `my-workspace/docs/INDEX.md`
- `competition/full-flow-demo-plan.md`
- `competition/README.md`
- `competition/verification-evidence.md`
- `my-workspace/tickets/0010-transistor-to-gds-demo-bringup.md`

## Outcome

- Repo now explicitly targets both:
  1) analog neuromorphic progression, and
  2) full implementation-flow credibility (DC -> Innovus -> Calibre path).
- The next actionable track is ticket `0010-transistor-to-gds-demo-bringup.md`.

# Session: 2026-02-02 - Video Demo Vision Refresh

## Summary

Applied the updated "one terminal, one engineer" competition vision to docs
and capture references.

## Updates Made

- Added shot-by-shot runbook:
  - `competition/video-shot-script.md`
- Expanded coupled-waveform capture checklist:
  - `competition/waveform-capture-checklist.md`
- Reflected demo thesis in reference docs:
  - `competition/full-flow-demo-plan.md`
  - `my-workspace/docs/vision.md`
  - `my-workspace/docs/STATUS.md`
  - `my-workspace/docs/INDEX.md`
  - `competition/README.md`
- Updated ticket `0010` with runbook completion.
- Added repeatability/process learnings to:
  - `skill.md`

## Practical Outcome

- Repo now contains a concrete 3-minute recording script with exact terminal
  commands and scene timing.
- Coupled-neuron waveform assets are explicitly included in capture guidance.

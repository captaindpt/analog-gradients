# Session: 2026-02-03 - Reference Doc Credibility Hardening

## Summary

Reviewed the updated vision/research reference docs and tightened claim scope
to keep the narrative defensible before continuing development.

## What Was Changed

1. `competition/verification-evidence.md`
   - Reframed energy benchmark section as non-normalized context.
   - Added explicit guardrails on cross-paper metric comparability.
   - Softened learning/novelty language to avoid overstating current evidence.

2. `competition/founder-thesis.md`
   - Reframed benchmark table as qualitative context.
   - Replaced strong comparative claims with caveated positioning language.
   - Clarified trainability statements as potential, not full in-circuit proof.
   - Softened toolchain-to-tapeout phrasing to reflect current smoke-flow stage.

3. `my-workspace/docs/STATUS.md`
   - Added milestone note for docs credibility hardening completion.

## Outcome

Reference docs now better align with present evidence quality:
- strong where measured,
- explicit where assumptions/normalization gaps remain,
- clear about what is future work.

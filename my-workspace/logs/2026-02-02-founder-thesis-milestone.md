# Session: 2026-02-02 - Founder Thesis Milestone

## Summary

Upgraded strategy framing from "EDA flow demo" to "original compute thesis"
and reflected it in core reference docs.

## Key Reframe

- Primary value: clockless continuous-time analog compute
- Supporting value: reproducible implementation-ready stack

## Updated References

- `competition/founder-thesis.md` (new)
- `my-workspace/docs/vision.md`
- `my-workspace/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `my-workspace/docs/STATUS.md`
- `my-workspace/docs/INDEX.md`
- `competition/full-flow-demo-plan.md`
- `competition/README.md`
- `my-workspace/tickets/0012-founder-thesis-evidence-track.md` (new ticket)

## Next Technical Proof Targets

1. ODE-fit validation
2. Temporal sensitivity extraction
3. Energy-per-event estimate

# Knowledgebase Index

This is the primary navigation root for planning and development.

## Source of Truth (Use in This Order)

1. Vision and product direction: `my-workspace/docs/vision.md`
2. Development workflow: `my-workspace/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
3. Technical progress tracker: `my-workspace/docs/STATUS.md`
4. Agent operating rules: `AGENTS.md`
5. Tooling quick reference: `skill.md`

## Core Docs

- GPU demo spec: `my-workspace/docs/gpu-spec.md`
- Personal roadmap: `my-workspace/docs/mani-plan.md`

## Armory / Environment

- Armory index: `my-workspace/docs/armory/README.md`
- Latest snapshot: `my-workspace/docs/armory/snapshot-2026-02-02/armory-summary.md`
- Full raw capture: `my-workspace/docs/armory/snapshot-2026-02-02/raw/`

## Execution Records

- Session logs: `my-workspace/logs/`
- Tickets: `my-workspace/tickets/`
- Competition strategy docs: `competition/`

## Repo Hygiene Rules

- Keep generated simulation waveforms/logs out of commits unless explicitly needed.
- Keep `results/*_test.txt` as the durable verification artifacts.
- Add new docs under `my-workspace/docs/` only when they are reusable references.
- Put time-stamped work notes in `my-workspace/logs/`.

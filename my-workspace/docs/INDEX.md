## Repo Hygiene Rules

- Keep generated simulation waveforms/logs out of commits unless explicitly needed.
- Keep `results/*_test.txt` as the durable verification artifacts.
- Add new docs under `my-workspace/docs/` only when they are reusable references.
- Put time-stamped work notes in `my-workspace/logs/`.

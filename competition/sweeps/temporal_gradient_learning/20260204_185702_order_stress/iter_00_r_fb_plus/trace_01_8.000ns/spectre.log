Transient Analysis `tran_test': time = (0 s -> 300 ns)
******************************************************

Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran_test'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Convergence achieved in 12 iterations.
DC simulation time: CPU = 434 us, elapsed = 435.114 us.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(spike0_n) = 1.8 V
I: I(V_VDD:p) = 667.6 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

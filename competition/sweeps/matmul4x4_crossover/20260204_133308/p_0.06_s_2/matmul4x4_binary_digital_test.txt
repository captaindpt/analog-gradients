=== Binary 4x4 Matmul (Digital Baseline) Verification ===
Transistor checkpoint: AND partial products + popcount adders
Date: Feb  4 13:35:49 2026

Stimulus matrices:
  A = [[0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0]]
  B = [[0 0 0 0] [1 1 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 1 0 0]]

Expected output Y = [[0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0]]

Decoded output matrix:
  row0: 0 0 0 0
  row1: 0 0 0 0
  row2: 0 0 0 0
  row3: 0 0 0 0

Decoded output vector: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Latency to full output-valid: 0.000 ns
Total energy (0-120ns): 5.089440e-16 J
Energy per operation (112 ops): 4.544143e-18 J/op

OK: decoded outputs match expected 4x4 matrix

=== PASS: Binary 4x4 digital matmul checkpoint verified ===

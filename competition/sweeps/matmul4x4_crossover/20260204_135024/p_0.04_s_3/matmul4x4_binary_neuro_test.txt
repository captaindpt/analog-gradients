Transistor checkpoint: coincidence products + membrane accumulation
Date: Feb  4 13:56:04 2026

Stimulus matrices:
  A = [[0 0 0 0] [0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0]]
  B = [[0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 1 0 0] [0 0 0 0]]

Expected output Y = [[0 0 0 0] [0 1 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0]]

Decoded output from partial products:
  row0: 0 0 0 0
  row1: 0 1 0 0
  row2: 0 0 0 0
  row3: 0 0 0 0

Decoded output vector: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Total partial spikes: 1
Latency to full output-valid: 2.224 ns
Total energy (0-120ns): 1.908894e-12 J
Energy per operation (112 ops): 1.704370e-14 J/op
Spike-model energy estimate (3.27 pJ/spike): 3.270000e-12 J

OK: decoded outputs match expected 4x4 matrix

=== PASS: Binary 4x4 neuro matmul checkpoint verified ===

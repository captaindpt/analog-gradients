=== Binary 4x4 Matmul (Neuro Path) Verification ===
Transistor checkpoint: coincidence products + membrane accumulation
Date: Feb  4 14:02:49 2026

Stimulus matrices:
  A = [[0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 1 0 0] [0 1 0 0]]
  B = [[0 0 0 1] [1 0 0 0] [0 0 1 0] [0 0 0 0]]

Expected output Y = [[0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [1 0 0 0] [1 0 0 0]]

Decoded output from partial products:
  row0: 0 0 0 0
  row1: 0 0 0 0
  row2: 0 0 0 0
  row3: 0 0 0 0

Decoded output vector: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Total partial spikes: 0
Latency to full output-valid: 0.000 ns
Total energy (0-120ns): 1.512049e-12 J
Energy per operation (112 ops): 1.350043e-14 J/op
Spike-model energy estimate (3.27 pJ/spike): 0.000000e+00 J

FAIL: decoded outputs do not match expected 4x4 matrix
